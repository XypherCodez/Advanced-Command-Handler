# Password Generator

Very simple password generator, generates a secure password with any length that you choose, great for any application.

**Requirements**
<br>
<br>
Node.js LTS version is recommended https://nodejs.org/en/<br>
Git https://git-scm.com/downloads

**How to Use**

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/XypherCodez/Simple-Password-Generator`
2. Open the `start.bat` file
3. Copy & Paste the password to whatever application you would like to use it on!

*There will be a much more advanced version of this releasing shortly!*

**Linux support**
<br>
Since .bat files do not work on linux, you can just run the main.js file directly instead of through the .bat file
First you open up a terminal and type in the following command: `git clone https://github.com/XypherCodez/Simple-Password-Generator.git`
what to do next is type in `cd Simple-Password-Generator` and finally you would type node main.js and boom the file is running.
